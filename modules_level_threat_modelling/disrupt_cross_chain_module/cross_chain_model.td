- Disrupt Cross-Chain Transactions
  - Exploit Vulnerabilities in Crosschain Module
    + Send malformed CCTX to cause processing errors
    - Assume module does not validate CCTX format properly?
      > If validation is implemented, this vector is mitigated [x]
    + Inject invalid contract address to cause transaction failure
    - Assume validation of contract addresses is not thorough?
      > Mitigation requires robust address and input validation [ ]
    + Overload module with high volume to cause denial of service
    - Assume rate limiting is not effective or absent?
      > Implement effective rate limiting and throttling [ ]

  - Compromise Observer Validators
    + Gain control over an observer node
    - Assume inadequate security controls on observer nodes?
      > Enforce strong security practices and regular audits [ ]
    + Disrupt the network communication between observers
    - Assume network traffic is not securely encrypted or authenticated?
      > Use encrypted channels and mutual TLS authentication [ ]

  - Manipulate Voting Mechanism
    + Spoof votes to falsify transaction consensus
    - Assume voting system does not authenticate voters?
      > Ensure authentication and integrity checks on voting [ ]
    + Flood system with invalid votes to prevent ballot finalization
    - Assume system does not have a mechanism to filter out spam votes?
      > Implement anti-spam protections and validate voter eligibility [ ]

  - Interfere with TSS Keysign Ceremony
    + Compromise the distributed key generation process
    - Assume the TSS ceremony does not use secure multiparty computation?
      > Employ secure TSS protocols with proven security properties [ ]
    + Interrupt the key signing ceremony with network attacks
    - Assume no fallback or retry mechanisms in place?
      > Design robust network protocols with redundancy [ ]

  - Attack Transaction Handling
    + Prevent the execution of valid CCTX by observer collusion
    - Assume a quorum of observers can be malicious?
      > Require a large and variable quorum for consensus [ ]
    + Replay old transactions to double-spend
    - Assume no nonce or replay protection is used?
      > Utilize nonces and timestamp checks to prevent replays [ ]

  - Exploit Administrative Functions
    + Abuse emergency action privileges to halt transactions
    - Assume emergency actions can be triggered without multi-sig?
      > Implement multi-sig requirements for critical actions [ ]
    + Modify permissions table to grant unauthorized actions
    - Assume permissions are not regularly audited or protected?
      > Regular audits and role-based access controls [ ]

  - Cause Network Instability
    + Induce network partitions to isolate validators
    - Assume no countermeasures against network partitioning?
      > Deploy network monitoring and partition detection systems [ ]
    + Create routing issues to delay transaction verification
    - Assume routing is not resilient to attacks?
      > Use multipath routing and secure BGP protocols [ ]

  - Third-party Service Attacks
    + Target oracles or APIs to feed incorrect data
    - Assume external data sources are trusted implicitly?
      > Implement data source verification and cross-checking [ ]

- Additional Mitigation Strategies
  + Conduct regular penetration testing to discover new vulnerabilities
  + Employ continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) with automated security checks
  + Implement a bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure
