__Goal: Disrupt Cross Chain Module__

- **Disrupt Voting on \n Inbound and \n Outbound Transactions**\n\n\n
  + Compromise \n ballot CRUD operations\n\n\n
    - Manipulate \n stored ballots \n to alter vote outcomes\n\n\n
      > Implement cryptographic \n audit trails \n for ballot changes [ ]\n\n\n
      > Conduct periodic \n integrity checks \n on ballot storage [x]\n\n\n
    - Inject logic bugs to prevent correct ballot finalization\n\n\n
      > Use formal verification for critical voting functions [ ]\n\n\n
      > Set up automated testing for all voting pathways [x]\n\n\n
  + Gain unauthorized access \n to add or \n remove observer validators\n\n\n
    - Exploit access \n control vulnerabilities \n in `MsgAddObserver`\n\n\n
      > Enforce strict \n access control \n policies and permissions [ ]\n\n\n
      > Utilize multi-factor \n authentication \n for admin actions [x]\n\n\n
    - Modify genesis settings to redirect \n observer authorizations\n\n\n
      > Lock down genesis \n configuration changes [ ]\n\n\n
      > Use transparent and \n auditable genesis \n change proposals [x]\n\n\n
  + Change core \n parameters to invalid settings\n\n\n
    - Exploit lack of validation in `MsgUpdateCoreParams`\n\n\n
      > Implement comprehensive parameter validation checks [ ]\n\n\n
      > Require consensus for any parameter change [x]\n\n\n
  + Submit false blame information through `MsgAddBlameVote`\n\n\n
    - Fabricate blame to disqualify honest validators\n\n\n
      > Require proof of misbehavior for blame acceptance [ ]\n\n\n
      > Set up a dispute resolution mechanism for blame votes [ ]\n\n\n
    - Maliciously toggle inbound or outbound transaction flags\n\n\n
      > Apply change delays and notifications for flag updates [ ]\n\n\n
      > Multi-signature requirements for critical flag changes [x]\n\n\n
  + Interrupt or incorrectly initiate key generation\n\n\n
    - Send false `MsgUpdateKeygen` to reset keygen process\n\n\n
      > Rate limit keygen updates to prevent spam [ ]\n\n\n
      > Verify the necessity of keygen before processing [x]\n\n\n
  + Add incorrect block headers through `MsgAddBlockHeader`\n\n\n
    - Submit false headers to disrupt chain synchronization\n\n\n
      > Employ consensus verification for new block headers [ ]\n\n\n
      > Use multiple independent observer validators for header verification [x]\n\n\n
  + Directly attack observer nodes to manipulate votes\n\n\n
    - Use DDoS attacks to incapacitate observer nodes during voting\n\n\n
      > Distribute observer nodes geographically for resilience [ ]\n\n\n
      > Implement DDoS protection and anomaly detection systems [x]\n\n\n
    - Intercept and alter votes during transmission\n\n\n
      > Encrypt inter-validator communication [x]\n\n\n
      > Use secure, authenticated channels for node communication [ ]\n\n\n
  + Use vulnerable library versions in observer module\n\n\n
    - Introduce bugs or backdoors through dependencies\n\n\n
      > Automate dependency \n updates with \n security review processes [ ]\n\n\n
      > Monitor third-party \n libraries for \n known vulnerabilities [x]\n\n\n
  + Exploit transaction \n replay for double voting\n\n\n
    - Reuse vote \n transactions to skew results\n\n\n
      > Implement unique transaction identifiers [x]\n\n\n
      > Enforce transaction \n finality and nonce checks [ ]\n\n\n
  + Create misconfiguration in observer nodes\n\n\n
    - Alter node settings \n to cause incorrect vote casting\n\n\n
      > Standardize \n configuration \n deployment with audit trails [ ]\n\n\n
      > Regularly review and test node configurations [x]\n\n\n
  + Bypass access control to execute unauthorized actions\n\n\n
    - Perform actions as a \n non-admin or incorrect admin group\n\n\n
      > Enforce role-based \n access control \n with strict verification [x]\n\n\n
      > Regularly \n audit admin \n groups and access logs [ ]\n\n\n
