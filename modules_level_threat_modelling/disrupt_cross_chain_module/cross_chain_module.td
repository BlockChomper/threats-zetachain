__Disrupt Inbound and Outbound Transaction Processing\n\n\n__

- Compromise observer validators\n\n\n
  + Gain unauthorized access to zetaclient\n\n\n
    > Brute force or exploit vulnerabilities in zetaclient\n\n\n
    - [ ] Strengthen zetaclient security\n\n\n
  + Disrupt the observer validators' network\n\n\n
    > Perform a DDoS attack on observer validators\n\n\n
    - [ ] Implement DDoS protection and mitigation strategies\n\n\n
  + Compromise observer validators' voting process\n\n\n
    > Inject false votes or prevent vote submission\n\n\n
    - [ ] Employ vote validation and anti-tampering mechanisms\n\n\n

- Target the TSS keysigning ceremony\n\n\n
  + Intercept and manipulate keys during the ceremony\n\n\n
    > Exploit insecure key exchange protocols\n\n\n
    - [ ] Enforce secure key exchange mechanisms\n\n\n
  + Disrupt the consensus process of the TSS ceremony\n\n\n
    > Introduce fake observer validators to the ceremony\n\n\n
    - [ ] Require strict authentication of participants in the TSS ceremony\n\n\n

- Attack the messaging system\n\n\n
  + Flood MsgVoteOnObservedInboundTx and MsgVoteOnObservedOutboundTx with spam\n\n\n
    > Overwhelm the system with high volumes of fake votes\n\n\n
    - [ ] Rate limit and validate message authenticity\n\n\n
  + Inject malicious code into transaction messages\n\n\n
    > Exploit vulnerabilities in message parsing\n\n\n
    - [ ] Sanitize and validate all incoming messages rigorously\n\n\n

- Manipulate or block transaction finalization\n\n\n
  + Prevent the last vote for ballot finalization\n\n\n
    > Attack the communication channel for the last vote\n\n\n
    - [ ] Employ redundant communication channels and fallback mechanisms\n\n\n
  + Alter transaction status illegitimately\n\n\n
    > Gain control over the module storing transaction states\n\n\n
    - [ ] Harden access control to transaction state data\n\n\n

- Compromise chain data integrity\n\n\n
  + Modify chain nonces and heights\n\n\n
    > Gain write access to the chain data storage\n\n\n
    - [ ] Implement robust access controls and audit trails\n\n\n
  + Introduce false outbound transactions\n\n\n
    > Spoof outbound transaction messages or IDs\n\n\n
    - [ ] Utilize cryptographic proofs for transaction authenticity\n\n\n

- Attack gas price submission and recording\n\n\n
  + Submit incorrect gas prices to disrupt median calculation\n\n\n
    > Compromise observer validators or submission process\n\n\n
    - [ ] Validate gas price submissions and detect outliers\n\n\n

- Exploit admin policy account privileges\n\n\n
  + Gain unauthorized access to admin policy account\n\n\n
    > Phishing attacks or exploit admin interfaces\n\n\n
    - [ ] Multi-factor authentication and secure admin operations\n\n\n
