__Goal: Disrupt Cross Chain Module__

- **Disrupt Voting on \n Inbound and Outbound Transactions**
  + Compromise ballot \n CRUD operations\n\n\n
    - Manipulate stored \n ballots to alter vote outcomes\n\n\n
      > Implement cryptographic \n audit trails for ballot changes [ ]\n\n\n
      > Conduct periodic integrity \n checks on ballot storage [x]\n\n\n
    - Inject logic bugs to prevent \n correct ballot finalization\n\n\n
      > Use formal verification for \n critical voting functions [ ]\n\n\n
      > Set up automated testing for \n all voting pathways [x]\n\n\n
  + Gain unauthorized access to add or \n  remove observer validators\n\n\n
    - Exploit access control \n vulnerabilities in `MsgAddObserver`\n\n\n
      > Enforce strict access \n control policies and permissions [ ]\n\n\n
      > Utilize multi-factor authentication \n for admin actions [x]\n\n\n
    - Modify genesis settings to \n redirect observer authorizations\n\n\n
      > Lock down genesis configuration changes [ ]\n\n\n
      > Use transparent and \n auditable genesis change proposals [x]\n\n\n
  + Change core parameters to invalid settings\n\n\n
    - Exploit lack of \n validation in `MsgUpdateCoreParams`\n\n\n
      > Implement comprehensive \n parameter validation checks [ ]\n\n\n
      > Require consensus for any \n parameter change [x]\n\n\n
  + Submit false blame \n information through `MsgAddBlameVote`\n\n\n
    - Fabricate blame to disqualify honest validators\n\n\n
      > Require proof of misbehavior for blame acceptance [ ]\n\n\n
      > Set up a dispute \n resolution mechanism for blame votes [ ]\n\n\n
    - Maliciously toggle inbound \n or outbound transaction flags\n\n\n
      > Apply change delays and \n notifications for flag updates [ ]\n\n\n
      > Multi-signature requirements \n for critical flag changes [x]\n\n\n
  + Interrupt or incorrectly initiate key generation\n\n\n
    - Send false `MsgUpdateKeygen` \n to reset keygen process\n\n\n
    - Submit false headers to \n disrupt chain synchronization\n\n\n
      > Employ consensus \n verification for new block headers [ ]\n\n\n
      > Use multiple \n independent observer validators for header verification [x]\n\n\n
  + Directly attack observer nodes to manipulate votes\n\n\n
    - Use DDoS attacks to \n incapacitate observer nodes during voting\n\n\n
      > Distribute observer \n nodes geographically for resilience [ ]\n\n\n
      > Implement DDoS protection and anomaly detection systems [x]\n\n\n
    - Intercept and alter \n votes during transmission\n\n\n
      > Encrypt inter-validator communication [x]\n\n\n
      > Use secure, authenticated channels for node communication [ ]\n\n\n
  + Use vulnerable library \n versions in observer module\n\n\n
    - Introduce bugs or \n backdoors through dependencies\n\n\n
      > Automate dependency updates with security review processes [ ]\n\n\n
      > Monitor third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities [x]\n\n\n
  + Exploit transaction \n replay for double voting\n\n\n
    - Reuse vote transactions \n to skew results\n\n\n
      > Implement unique transaction \n identifiers [x]\n\n\n
      > Enforce transaction \n finality and nonce checks [ ]\n\n\n
  + Create misconfiguration in o\n bserver nodes\n\n\n
    - Alter node settings to \n cause incorrect vote casting\n\n\n
      > Standardize configuration \n deployment with audit trails [ ]\n\n\n
      > Regularly review and \n test node configurations [x]\n\n\n
  + Bypass access control to \n execute unauthorized actions\n\n\n
    - Perform actions as a \n non-admin or incorrect admin group\n\n\n
      > Enforce role-based \n access control with strict verification [x]\n\n\n
      > Regularly audit admin \n groups and access logs [ ]\n\n\n
