# What is threat modelling

Threat modeling is a structured approach that involves identifying and documenting potential threats to a system and outlining the harm these threats could cause from the perspective of an attacker. The goal of threat modeling is to provide a strategic overview of the security risks to a project, enabling organizations to think about, discuss, and prioritize security at every stage of the software development lifecycle. 

It's a way for defenders to shift their mindset from simple checklists to a more complex understanding of the attack vectors, as attackers tend to think in terms of interconnected graphs rather than linear lists.

Threatdown is an open standard designed to integrate threat modeling into all phases of development. It offers a friendly notation system that is easy to learn for those already familiar with Markdown. It's simple and constrained, focusing on the most critical aspects of security, and it's maintainable due to its plain text format, which simplifies collaboration and updating. 

Threatdown compiles into visual graphs with the help of mermaid.js, making the threat models easier to understand and communicate.

Here's a brief summary of how Threatdown works:

- **Conditions**: These can be actions or states within the system that may lead to security risks.
- **Assumptions**: These are potential issues or states marked with a bullet ending in a question mark.
- **Mitigations**: These are solutions or safeguards that can block a condition or assumption, marked as complete [x] or incomplete [ ].
- **Logical Combinations**: Elements within the threat model can be combined using AND (+) or OR (-) bullets.
- **Comments**: Nested comments can be added under any item with a ">" to provide additional explanations.

To visualize a threat model created with Threatdown, one can run a command to generate a graph, which helps in visualizing the interconnections and dependencies of various components within the threat model.

Lastly, threat models, as documented by Threatdown or any other method, should be treated with high sensitivity, as they contain critical information about the system's vulnerabilities that could be exploited if fallen into the wrong hands. Threatdown is maintained by Code4rena, and they encourage contributions to develop, extend, and improve the standard through collaboration on GitHub.

# How intrepret attack tree

Identifying the goal is critical as it forms the foundation of the attack tree.

To utilize an attack tree for security research, follow these steps:

1. Copy the content of `attack_tree.td`.
2. Paste it into a conversation with ChatGPT.
3. Request ChatGPT to generate a list of "can you" questions for auditors and security researchers based on the provided attack tree.
here is the an example output

```
Based on the attack tree provided, here's a list of "can you" questions for auditors and security researchers to probe for vulnerabilities:

1. **Inbound Transaction Handling**
   - Can you send malformed transactions to generate processing errors?
   - Can you submit transactions to incorrect contract addresses to induce failures?
   - Can you manipulate transaction destination data to misroute funds?
   - Can you input incorrect token amounts to disrupt account balances?
   - Can you provide the wrong gas amounts to cause transaction stalling?

2. **System Overload**
   - Can you overload the system with excessive transactions?
   - Can you exceed transaction rate limits to trigger a system slowdown?

3. **Replay Attack**
   - Can you perform a replay attack to double-process transactions?

4. **Transaction Delays**
   - Can you initiate transactions that persist without completion to timeout the system?
   - Can you interfere with network traffic to destabilize transaction processing?

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - Can you trigger ambiguous error messages through malformed transactions?
   - Can you reveal deficiencies in transaction logs to prevent proper auditing?

6. **External Chain Dependence**
   - Can you exploit peak times to test the system's congestion management?
   - Can you compromise external services like oracles to affect system reliability?

7. **Outbound Transaction Issues**
   - Can you test the system's response to incomplete outbound transaction data?
   - Can you deceive transaction observers with incorrect data?

8. **Network Communication**
   - Can you block or delay transaction broadcasting to external chains?
   - Can you prevent confirmations from being recognized to delay transaction finality?

9. **Consensus Mechanism**
   - Can you disrupt observer voting to challenge transaction confirmations?
   - Can you cause transaction processing issues through gas pricing manipulation?

10. **Economic Attacks**
    - Can you obtain network control through token majority acquisition?
    - Can you manipulate market prices to influence transaction validity?

11. **System Flaws and Configuration Errors**
    - Can you uncover and exploit error handling bugs to cause service outages?
    - Can you take advantage of outdated software libraries with known vulnerabilities?
    - Can you induce number overflows or underflows to corrupt transaction logic?
    - Can you exploit system misconfigurations for unauthorized actions?

# How to generate more attack tree

Attack trees have many variations because they are based on the end goal of an attack. 

To create new trees, it's effective to use a smaller goal or a leaf from an existing tree as the starting point.
 
This approach helps to systematically uncover different security threats by building out from specific parts of the larger attack scenario.
