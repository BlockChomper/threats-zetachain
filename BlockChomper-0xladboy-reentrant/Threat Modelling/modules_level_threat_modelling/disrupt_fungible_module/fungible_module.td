    - Manipulate gas limit settings \n in `MsgDeployFungibleCoinZRC20`\n\n\n
      + Set too high gas limits \n to waste resources\n\n\n
        > Establish maximum gas \n limit caps [x]\n\n\n
      + Set too low gas limits to \n fail contract creation\n\n\n
        > Define minimum gas thresholds \n based on historical data [ ]\n\n\n
    - Interfere with \n system contract updates\n\n\n
      + Unauthorized change of system contract address\n\n\n
        > Require multi-signature \n validation for system contract updates [x]\n\n\n
  + **Deposit Flow Disruption**\n\n\n
    - Attack `DepositZRC20AndCallContract` logic\n\n\n
      + Pass invalid or \n malicious contract calls\n\n\n
        > Enforce strict validation \n of contract call parameters [ ]\n\n\n
      + Send deposits to trigger \n unhandled exceptions\n\n\n
        > Continuous fuzzing tests \n to uncover unhandled exceptions [ ]\n\n\n
    - Manipulate ZRC20 token liquidity pools\n\n\n
      + Artificially inflate or \n deflate liquidity\n\n\n
        > Implement liquidity monitoring \n and anomaly detection [ ]\n\n\n
    - Abuse ZRC20 withdrawal fees setting\n\n\n
      + Set exorbitant withdrawal \n fees to deter token redemption\n\n\n
        > Enforce limits \n on fee adjustments [ ]\n\n\n
      + Reduce fees to zero, \n impacting economic incentives\n\n\n
        > Set minimum fee thresholds [x]\n\n\n
  + **Smart Contract Update Manipulation**\n\n\n
    - Utilize `MsgUpdateContractBytecode` \n to introduce vulnerabilities\n\n\n
      + Replace contract bytecode with \n flawed or malicious versions\n\n\n
        > Maintain a whitelist of \n authorized bytecode sources [ ]\n\n\n
        > Require consensus for \n bytecode updates [x]\n\n\n
  + **Liquidity and Cap Manipulation**\n\n\n
    - Modify ZRC20 liquidity cap to \n restrict token usage\n\n\n
      + Increase cap to allow \n potential token oversupply\n\n\n
        > Automated checks against \n market cap and supply algorithms [ ]\n\n\n
      + Decrease cap to limit token accessibility\n\n\n
        > Dynamic cap adjustments \n based on usage metrics [ ]\n\n\n
  + **Contract Pausing Abuse**\n\n\n
    - Inappropriately pause or \n unpause ZRC20 contracts\n\n\n
      + Cause denial of service by \n pausing active tokens\n\n\n
        > Decentralize the pausing \n mechanism to require broader consensus [ ]\n\n\n
      + Unpause compromised tokens \n leading to potential exploits\n\n\n
        > Implement an emergency response \n protocol for suspicious activities [ ]\n\n\n
  + **Permission Exploitation**\n\n\n
    - Gain unauthorized admin access \n to broadcast sensitive messages\n\n\n\n
      + Social engineering to obtain \n admin credentials\n\n\n
        > Regular security \n training for admin personnel [ ]\n\n\n
      + Exploit system misconfigurations\n\n\n
        > Conduct frequent system configuration audits [ ]\n\n\n
  + **Attack Vectors Specific to ZetaChain**\n\n\n
    - Utilize vulnerable \n versions of libraries in ZetaChain\n\n\n
      + Force the system \n to use outdated dependencies\n\n\n\n
        > Automate dependency updates \n with security checks [ ]\n\n\n
    - Exploit transaction replay for \n double deposit or deployment\n\n\n
      + Replay past transactions to duplicate tokens\n\n\n
        > Implement nonce or similar \n mechanisms to ensure transaction uniqueness [x]\n\n\n
    - Induce overflows/underflows in token-related operations\n\n\n
      + Perform arithmetic operations \n that exceed storage limits\n\n\n
        > Use safe arithmetic libraries \n that revert on overflows/underflows [x]\n\n\n
    - Cause system panic through crafted payloads\n\n\n
      + Send specially crafted messages to validators to crash the system\n\n\n
        > Enforce input validation and limit \n message payload sizes [ ]\n\n\n
        > Run validators in isolated \n environments to contain failures [ ]\n\n\n
