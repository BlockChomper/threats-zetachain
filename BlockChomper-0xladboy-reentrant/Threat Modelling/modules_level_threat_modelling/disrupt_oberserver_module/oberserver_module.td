__Goal: Disrupt Observer Module\n\n\n__

- Disrupt Voting\n\n\n
  + Undermine Ballot Finalization\n\n\n
    - Compromise ballot CRUD operations\n\n\n
      + Manipulate stored ballots to alter vote outcomes\n\n\n
        > Implement cryptographic audit trails \n for ballot changes [ ]\n\n\n
        > Conduct periodic integrity checks  \n on ballot storage [x]\n\n\n
    - Disrupt the helper functions that determine  \n ballot finalization\n\n\n
      + Inject logic bugs to prevent  \n correct ballot finalization\n\n\n
        > Use formal verification for critical voting functions [ ]\n\n\n
        > Set up automated testing for all voting pathways [x]\n\n\n
  + Manipulate Observer Validator Authorization\n\n\n
    - Gain unauthorized access to add or  \n remove observer validators?\n\n\n
      + Exploit access control vulnerabilities in `MsgAddObserver`\n\n\n
        > Enforce strict access control  \n policies and permissions [ ]\n\n\n
        > Utilize multi-factor authentication  \n for admin actions [x]\n\n\n
    - Tamper with the mapping between chains  \n and observer accounts?\n\n\n
      + Modify genesis settings to redirect \n observer authorizations\n\n\n
        > Lock down genesis configuration changes [ ]\n\n\n
        > Use transparent and auditable \n genesis change proposals [x]\n\n\n
  + Attack Core Parameter Updates\n\n\n
    - Change core parameters to invalid settings?\n\n\n
      + Exploit lack of validation in \n `MsgUpdateCoreParams`\n\n\n
        > Implement comprehensive parameter \n validation checks [ ]\n\n\n
        > Require consensus for any parameter change [x]\n\n\n
  + Exploit Voting Mechanisms\n\n\n
    - Submit false blame information \n through `MsgAddBlameVote`?\n\n\n
      + Fabricate blame to disqualify \n honest validators\n\n\n
        > Require proof of misbehavior \n for blame acceptance [ ]\n\n\n
        > Set up a dispute resolution \n mechanism for blame votes [ ]\n\n\n
    - Manipulate crosschain flags to disrupt \n transaction flow?\n\n\n
      + Maliciously toggle inbound or outbound \n transaction flags\n\n\n
        > Apply change delays and notifications \n for flag updates [ ]\n\n\n
        > Multi-signature requirements for \n critical flag changes [x]\n\n\n
  + Subvert Key Generation\n\n\n
    - Interrupt or incorrectly initiate key generation?\n\n\n
      + Send false `MsgUpdateKeygen` to reset keygen process\n\n\n
        > Rate limit keygen updates to prevent spam [ ]\n\n\n
        > Verify the necessity of keygen before processing [x]\n\n\n
  + Block Header Voting Manipulation\n\n\n
    - Add incorrect block headers through `MsgAddBlockHeader`?\n\n\n
      + Submit false headers to disrupt chain synchronization\n\n\n
        > Employ consensus verification for new block headers [ ]\n\n\n
        > Use multiple independent observer validators \n for header verification [x]\n\n\n
  + Observer Node Compromise\n\n\n
    - Directly attack observer nodes to manipulate votes?\n\n\n
      + Use DDoS attacks to incapacitate observer nodes during voting\n\n\n
        > Distribute observer nodes geographically for resilience [ ]\n\n\n
        > Implement DDoS protection and anomaly detection systems [x]\n\n\n
    - Infiltrate observer node communication channels?\n\n\n
      + Intercept and alter votes during transmission\n\n\n
        > Encrypt inter-validator communication [x]\n\n\n
        > Use secure, authenticated channels for node communication [ ]\n\n\n
  + Systemic Attack Vectors\n\n\n
    - Use vulnerable library versions in observer module?\n\n\n
      + Introduce bugs or backdoors through dependencies\n\n\n
        > Automate dependency updates with security review processes [ ]\n\n\n
        > Monitor third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities [x]\n\n\n
    - Exploit transaction replay for double voting?\n\n\n
      + Reuse vote transactions to skew results\n\n\n
        > Implement unique transaction identifiers [x]\n\n\n
        > Enforce transaction finality and nonce checks [ ]\n\n\n
    - Create misconfiguration in observer nodes?\n\n\n
      + Alter node settings to cause incorrect vote casting\n\n\n
        > Standardize configuration deployment with audit trails [ ]\n\n\n
        > Regularly review and test node configurations [x]\n\n\n
    - Bypass access control to execute unauthorized actions?\n\n\n
      + Perform actions as a non-admin or incorrect admin group\n\n\n
        > Enforce role-based access control with strict verification [x]\n\n\n
        > Regularly audit admin groups and access logs [ ]\n\n\n
