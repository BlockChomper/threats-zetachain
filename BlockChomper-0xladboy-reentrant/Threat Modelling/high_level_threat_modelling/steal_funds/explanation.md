## Goal: Steal user funds

### Exploit Inbound Transaction Processing
- Insert malicious code into smart contracts.
- Trigger unauthorized fund transfers during CCTX.
- Tamper with transaction data payloads.
- Redirect funds to attacker-controlled addresses.
- Alter CCTX destination details.
- Reroute funds to attacker's account.
- Modify transaction token amounts.
- Extract more than authorized amounts.

### Manipulate Outbound Transactions
- Intercept and alter outbound transaction data.
- Redirect funds to incorrect destinations.
- Compromise observer nodes validating transactions.
- Confirm fraudulent transactions via compromised nodes.
- Hack TSS keysigning process.
- Authorize illegitimate transactions to attacker's benefit.

### Control Over Network Consensus
- Gain majority control over consensus nodes.
- Validate unauthorized transactions on the blockchain.
- Execute Sybil attacks to influence the network.
- Create fake identities to sway consensus.

### Disrupt Transaction Verification
- Send transactions with invalid signatures.
- Introduce errors into the verification process.
- Overload the network with transactions.
- Disrupt normal transaction verification.

### Abuse Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
- Exploit bugs in smart contracts.
- Divert funds without proper authorization.
- Invoke unintended smart contract functions.
- Manipulate contracts to release funds.

### Undermine System Configuration
- Exploit system misconfigurations.
- Access restricted capabilities or data.
- Utilize system updates for backdoor insertion.
- Introduce new vulnerabilities during patches.

### Market Manipulation for Economic Gain
- Conduct pump and dump schemes.
- Artificially inflate token prices.
- Manipulate liquidity in markets.
- Cause price slippage for unfair gains.

### Perform Double Spend Attacks
- Exploit transaction malleability.
- Spend funds multiple times pre-acknowledgment.
- Broadcast conflicting transactions simultaneously.
- Trick network with race attacks for double spending.
