__Goal: Freeze fund\n__

- **Inbound Transaction \n Handling Issues** \n\n\n
  + Send invalid CCTXs \n to cause processing errors.\n\n\n
  + Use wrong contract addresses \n to make transactions fail.\n\n\n
  + Alter destination data \n to misroute transactions.\n\n\n
  + Input incorrect token amounts to \n mess with account balances.\n\n\n
  + Provide wrong gas \n amounts to stall transactions.\n\n\n

- **System Overload**
  + Flood with too many \n transactions to overwhelm the system.\n\n\n
  + Send transactions faster than \n the rate limit to force a system slowdown.\n\n\n

- **Replay Attack Exploitation**\n\n\n
  + Resend old transactions to trick \n the system into processing them again.\n\n\n

- **Transaction Delays**\n\n\n
  + Start transactions that \n don't finish to cause system timeouts.\n\n\n
  + Mess with the network during \n transactions to create instability.\n\n\n

- **Error Handling and Logging Gaps**\n\n\n
  + Submit malformed transactions \n to trigger unhelpful error messages.\n\n\n
  + Challenge the completeness of \n transaction logs for auditing failures.\n\n\n

- **External Chain Weaknesses**
  + Send transactions during peak \n times to test how congestion is handled.\n\n\n
  + Disrupt or trick external services like oracles.\n\n\n

- **Outbound Transaction Weaknesses**\n\n\n
  + Start outbound transactions \n with missing information to test rejection.\n\n\n
  + Feed false data to observers \n to mislead transaction verification.\n\n\n
  + Tamper with the data during \n the TSS keysign process.\n\n\n

- **Network Communication Interference**\n\n\n
  + Block transactions from \n being broadcasted to external chains.\n\n\n
  + Prevent confirmations from \n being observed to delay finality.\n\n\n

- **Consensus Mechanism Disruption**\n\n\n
  + Cause confusion in observer \n voting to invalidate transaction confirmations.\n\n\n
  + Send transactions with gas \n price issues to disrupt transaction processing.\n\n\n

- **Economic Attack and Majority Control**\n\n\n
  + Buy or influence a majority of \n tokens to gain control over the network.\n\n\n
  + Manipulate market prices to affect \n transaction validity and network control.\n\n\n

- **System Flaws and Misconfigurations**\n\n\n
  + Find and trigger error \n handling bugs to crash services.\n\n\n
  + Exploit outdated software \n libraries with known issues.\n\n\n
  + Cause number overflows or \n underflows to corrupt transaction processing.\n\n\n
  + Take advantage of system \n setup mistakes for unauthorized access or actions\n\n\n
